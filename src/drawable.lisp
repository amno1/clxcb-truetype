;;; Finalizers run on the implementation's finalizer thread, but CLXCB's
;;; SEND-REQUEST is not synchronised: allocating the serial and writing the
;;; request are two separate steps.  A finalizer that wrote FreePixmap
;;; directly could interleave with a request the application thread is
;;; sending, corrupting the byte stream or the client's sequence count.
;;; Finalizers therefore only queue (KIND . ID) entries, per connection;
;;; FLUSH-DEFERRED-FREES sends them from the application's thread.
;;;
;;; The queue is weak on the connection, like *FILL-CACHE* and
;;; *MASK-GC-CACHE*: a connection that is dropped without being closed
;;; still has an open stream, so it cannot be recognised as dead by
;;; testing it, but once it is unreachable its bucket goes with it.  The
;;; lock is recursive in case an implementation runs a finalizer on the
;;; thread that already holds it.

;;; Drawables, and who frees what
;;;
;;; In the X protocol a DRAWABLE is only a type of XID: one that names a
;;; window or a pixmap.  The resources themselves, windows, pixmaps, and
;;; pictures, are what the server keeps, and whoever creates a resource
;;; is responsible for freeing it.  This library's DRAWABLE is a Lisp
;;; object around such an XID: it carries the connection the XID belongs
;;; to, the screen and visual, and the RENDER picture the library makes for
;;; drawing, which the library created and so always frees.
;;;
;;; Two facts about a drawable, kept apart:
;;;
;;;   What it is: the class.  A WINDOW or a PIXMAP; it decides which
;;;   request frees it, DestroyWindow or FreePixmap.  DRAWABLE is only
;;;   their common base and is not made itself.
;;;
;;;   Whether it is ours: :OWNED.  NIL (the default): the window or
;;;   pixmap belongs to whoever made it, an application's window, a
;;;   pixmap it manages, and only the picture is freed.  T: it was handed
;;;   to the drawable, and DESTROY-DRAWABLE -- or the garbage collector,
;;;   when the drawable is dropped -- frees it too.
