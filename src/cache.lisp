;; Lifetime note: *FILL-CACHE* is a two-level cache. The outer table maps
;; CONNECTION to an inner hash table of (COLOUR -> PICTURE).
;; It uses TRIVIAL-GARBAGE:MAKE-WEAK-HASH-TABLE with :WEAKNESS :KEY,
;; so a connection object that becomes unreachable is automatically collected
;; along with its inner colour cache. This prevents long-running applications
;; from leaking connection references and pictures across multiple connections.
